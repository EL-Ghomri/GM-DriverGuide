# Rosie

**Description**: A PoC AI assistant named "Rosie" which enabled the real-time assessment of a driver’s physical and mental state by utilizing metrics from both wearable devices and driver speech in order to proactively guard against occurrences such as Road Rage. Built using General Motor’s Next Generation Infotainment (NGI) toolkit with future consideration of using Reciptiviti, an API that enabled AI platforms to determine human emotions.
